In Python, function is a group of related statements that perform a specific task.

Syntax of Function
def function_name(parameters):
	"""docstring"""
	statement(s)
  
Above shown is a function definition which consists of following components.

Keyword def marks the start of function header.
A function name to uniquely identify it. 
Parameters (arguments) through which we pass values to a function. They are optional.
A colon (:) to mark the end of function header.
Optional documentation string (docstring) to describe what the function does.
One or more valid python statements that make up the function body. Statements must have same indentation level (usually 4 spaces).

	the person passed in as
	parameter"""

Function Call
Once we have defined a function, we can call it from another function, program or even the Python prompt.

>>> greeting('Rita')
Hello, Rita. Good morning!

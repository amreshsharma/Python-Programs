In Python, anonymous function is a function that is defined without a name.

While normal functions are defined using the def keyword, in Python anonymous functions are defined using the lambda keyword.

Syntax of Lambda Function
lambda arguments: expression

double = lambda x: x * 2

# Output: 12
print(double(6))

We use lambda functions when we require a nameless function for a short period of time.

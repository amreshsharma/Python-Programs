The list is a most versatile datatype available in Python which can be written as a list of comma-separated values (items) between 
square brackets.
Important thing about a list is that items in a list need not be of the same type.

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5 ];
list3 = ["a", "b", "c", "d"]

Accessing Values in Lists -
To access values in lists, use the square brackets for slicing along with the index or indices to obtain value available at that index.
Example:

list1 = ['physics', 'chemistry', 1997, 2000];
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 ];

print "list1[0]: ", list1[0]
print "list2[1:5]: ", list2[1:5]

#Output
list1[0]:  physics
list2[1:5]:  [2, 3, 4, 5]

You can update single or multiple elements of lists by giving the slice on the left-hand side of the assignment operator, and you can
add to elements in a list with the append() method.
